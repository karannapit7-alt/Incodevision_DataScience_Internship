# Incodevision Data Science Internship: Data Cleaning & EDA Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset using *Python*. The goal was to transform raw data into a clean, analyzed format ready for business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* *Python*: Core programming language.
* *Pandas*: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* *NumPy*: For numerical operations.
* *Matplotlib/Seaborn*: For data visualization.
* *Jupyter Notebook*: Development environment.

## 📋 Key Tasks Performed

### Task 01: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
1. Loaded Raw Data: Processed CSV files to start the analysis.
2. Handled Missing Values: Identified and filled/dropped null values to ensure data quality.
3. Removed Duplicates: Cleaned the dataset by removing redundant entries.
4. Standardized Formats: Corrected data types (Dates, Strings) for consistency.

Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Statistical Summary: Analyzed mean, median, and distribution of the data.
2. Data Visualization: Created charts to extract insights and identify patterns.
3. Correlation Analysis: Found relationships between different data variables.

✅ Results
1. Successfully transformed a messy dataset into a Cleaned_Dataset.csv.
2. Extracted key insights that can help in decision-making processes.
