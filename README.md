# Incodevision Data Science Internship: Data Cleaning & EDA Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset using *Python*. The goal was to transform raw data into a clean, analyzed format ready for business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* *Python*: Core programming language.
* *Pandas*: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* *NumPy*: For numerical operations.
* *Matplotlib/Seaborn*: For data visualization.
* *Jupyter Notebook*: Development environment.

## 📋 Key Tasks Performed

### Task 01: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* *Loaded Raw Data*: Processed CSV files to start the analysis.
* *Handled Missing Values*: Identified and filled/dropped null values to ensure data quality.
* *Removed Duplicates*: Cleaned the dataset by removing redundant entries.
* *Standardized Formats*: Corrected data types (Dates, Strings) for consistency.

### Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* *Statistical Summary*: Analyzed mean, median, and distribution of the data.
* *Data Visualization*: Created charts to extract insights and identify patterns.
* *Correlation Analysis*: Found relationships between different data variables.

## ✅ Results
* Successfully transformed a messy dataset into a *Cleaned_Dataset.csv*.
* Extracted key insights that can help in decision-making processes.
