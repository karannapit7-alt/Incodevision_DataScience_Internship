# Incodevision_DataScience_Internship     Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a real-world dataset using Python and Pandas.  
The goal was to transform raw data into a clean dataset ready for analysis.

## Problem Statement
Datasets often have:
- Missing values  
- Duplicate records  
- Inconsistent data formats  

These issues make analysis difficult, so we applied data cleaning techniques to fix them.

## Tools 
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Tasks Performed
1. Loaded raw dataset (`.csv`)  
2. Identified and handled missing values  
3. Removed duplicate entries  
4. Standardized formats (dates, strings)  
5. Exported cleaned data

## Dataset
Source: Provided as internship task (or mention if from Kaggle / upload link)  
*Include a sample preview or link if possible.*

##  Results
- Cleaned dataset exported as `cleaned_dataset.csv`  
- Ready for analysis / modelling  
- Improved data quality and consistency

## How to Run
1. Clone repository  
2. Open Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run each cell step by step  
4. Results will generate cleaned dataset

##  Learning Outcome
- Learned real-world data preprocessing techniques  
- Improved Pandas skills  
- Gained hands-on with data cleaning workflows
