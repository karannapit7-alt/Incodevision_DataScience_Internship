# Incodevision_DataScience_Internship: Data Cleaning & EDA Project.


# 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset using *Python. The goal was to transform raw data into a clean, analyzed format ready for business insights.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
1. Python: Core programming language.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
3. NumPy: For numerical operations.
4. Matplotlib: For data visualization.
5. Jupyter Notebook: Development environment.

# 📋 Key Tasks Performed

# Task 01: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
1. Loaded Raw Data: Processed CSV files to start the analysis.
2. Handled Missing Values: Identified and filled/dropped null values to ensure data quality.
3. Removed Duplicates: Cleaned the dataset by removing redundant entries.
4. Standardized Formats: Corrected data types (Dates, Strings) for consistency.

# Task 02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Statistical Summary: Analyzed mean, median, and distribution of the data.
2. Data Visualization: Created charts to extract insights and identify patterns.
3. Correlation Analysis: Found relationships between different data variables.

#  Results
1. Successfully transformed a messy dataset into a Cleaned_Dataset.csv.
2. Extracted key insights that can help in decision-making processes.
